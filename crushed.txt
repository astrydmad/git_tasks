Brothers, my brothers
Is this all that we are
Sisters, my sisters
We've been crushed by the fists of god

Welcome to the free world
Where nothing's as it seems
Tell me, can you find a cure
When you can't see, and you can't feel the disease
Can you seek a higher truth
When you're living on your knees
Where freedom grows from blood soaked soil
In the lands of hypocrisy

'Cause if you can't see the chains tell me what use is a key
It's cash, blood and oil, in the age of the refugee
They're trying to buy our minds, we ain't selling
Bang, bang, bang, hear they're nailing down the coffins
